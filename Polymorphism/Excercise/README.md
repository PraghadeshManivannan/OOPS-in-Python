Create a class called Square and perform the following tasks -


(i) Create two objects for this class squareOne and squareTwo
(ii) Find the result of side of squareOne to the power of side of squareTwo


Example: If squareOne has length of 2cm each side and squareTwo has a length of 4cm each side, squareOne ** squareTwo should return 16, which is 2 to the power of 4.


Hint: While performing SquareOne ** SquareTwo, you need to overload __pow__() method
